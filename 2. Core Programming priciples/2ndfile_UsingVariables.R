#we will now learn how to use variables 

A<- 10
B<- 5

C<- 10+5
# but to print the value of C we simply need to write 
C

#Note- In R we have to selected all the code we wanna run or run each line sperately becoz in R only the line with cursur is run at time of execution 

#lets take one more example

#variable1
var1<-2.5
#variable2
var2<-4

result<-var1/var2
result

answer<-sqrt(var2)
answer

#sqrt is a function which gives the square root

#lets now work with characters

greeting<- "Hello"
name<- "Rishabh"
message<- paste(greeting, name)
message
